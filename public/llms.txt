# Locusify

> Locusify is a free, browser-based travel tool that transforms GPS-tagged photos into interactive route maps and animated journey replays — all processed locally on your device, with zero uploads and complete privacy.

## What Locusify Does

Locusify reads the GPS coordinates embedded in each photo's EXIF metadata, plots them on an interactive map, and lets you replay your journey as a cinematic video. No account, no subscription, no server — everything runs in the browser.

1. **Upload** GPS-tagged travel photos (JPG, PNG, HEIC, WebP, AVIF)
2. **Extract** — GPS coordinates are parsed from EXIF data entirely in-browser
3. **Visualize** — an interactive map renders your route with photo markers, clusters, and an animated trajectory line
4. **Replay** — watch the journey play back in chronological order, then export as MP4

## Key Features

- **GPS Photo Mapping** — Automatically extracts location data from EXIF metadata and plots photos on an interactive map
- **Trajectory Replay** — Timeline-based animated route playback with smooth camera follow and adjustable speed
- **Video Export** — Record and download your journey replay as an MP4 video
- **Photo Clusters** — Groups nearby photos at higher zoom levels for a clean, readable map
- **100% Local Processing** — All parsing, rendering, and export happen in the browser; photos are never uploaded
- **Drag-and-Drop Upload** — Upload multiple photos at once with automatic GPS validation
- **Multi-language** — Available in English and Chinese (中文)
- **Dark / Light Mode** — Follows system preference or can be toggled manually

## Privacy

Locusify is privacy-first by design. Photos are processed entirely in the browser using JavaScript. No photos, GPS coordinates, or personal data are ever sent to a server. Closing the browser tab clears all data. The only external service used is anonymous page-view analytics (Google Analytics).

## Who It's For

- Solo travelers who want to visualize and remember where they went
- Travel photographers with large batches of geotagged photos
- Vloggers and content creators who want a route replay video without video editing software
- Anyone curious about "where exactly did I go on that trip?"

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does Locusify upload my photos?**
No. All processing happens locally in the browser. Photos never leave your device.

**What photo formats are supported?**
JPG, PNG, HEIC, WebP, and AVIF. At least 2 photos with valid GPS data are required to generate a trajectory.

**Is Locusify free?**
Yes — completely free, no account required, no feature paywalls.

**Can I export my journey as a video?**
Yes. After the trajectory replay, you can record and download it as an MP4.

**What if some photos don't have GPS data?**
Locusify validates GPS data on upload and clearly marks which photos have location data. Photos without GPS are excluded from the trajectory but remain listed.
